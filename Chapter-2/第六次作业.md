###Abstract
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of the trajectory of our cannon shell including both drag and the reduced air density at high altitude can be described by servel proper ordinary differential eqautions.From this point,we could try to use some ODEs to describe the realistic motion of cannon shell step by step,which means that we don't take the drag and the reduced density at high altitude at first, on the basis of this simplification, we will gradually add them to our model.Through the procedure from simple to complicate, ODEs will be inceased to describe the system more precise.

###Background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many realistic projectile motion of objects through the atmosphere are all able to be described by ordinary differential equations in which initial values are given and all can be solved using the Euler method.Thus, we hold the view that some ODEs can be found to describe our problem—— the trajectile of the cannon shell, which is just a simple projectile motion if air's drag isn't considered.And then we use another ODE to take the drag of air into account.But we know the air isn's well-distributed if the cannon shell flies high enough.For the reason of which,we must add ODEs to describe the reduced air density at high altitudes.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along this idea, we could find serials ODEs to make our physics procedure describes well, then Euler method is time to be taken to solve the ordinary differential equation group, which gives us access to do something interesting.

###The Text
####1.Exercise 2.9——The flying cannon shell
#####1.1 Problem
1. Calculate the trajectile of cannon shell including air drag;
2. Consider how the air's density vary with altitude and take it into the cannon shell's account;
3. Change the firing angles, perform the calculation and search the value of the angle which gives the maximum range.

#####1.2 Thinking
######1. No air
&nbsp;&nbsp;If we don't consider the air's drag, the cannon shell will make a simple oblique projectile motion, which can be described by ODE easily.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ground reference system，we consider the X direction and Y direction respectively.
